# NoteWebApp
This is a simple note web application using the Python Flask framework in conjunction with Bootstrap, HTML, and JavaScript.

## Features

2. Create, Read, Update, and Delete Notes: Easily manage your notes.
3. Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly interface using Bootstrap.

## Running The App

Separate the code into three folders, .js files would go into a folder called static, .html files would go into a folder called templates and .py files would go into website folder except main.py which is outside the website folder because it's an executable.

```bash
python main.py
```
